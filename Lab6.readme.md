# Executive Summary: With additional devices called virtual machines, we can benefit from wide variety of needed solutions. There are many companies and organizations which can utilize this electronic apparatus.
 
 # Virtualization (Groupwork)
 
1.	q) Write about your experience creating a virtual machine. Upload a screenshot of the vm. 

a)	First, I start with an app then download it to the computer; from there, I extract it, double click to run, and it will detect all the drives within the computer. Then I click Save, Paste, and then Create in the ‘C’ drive in the computer. In the computer desktop, double click the Virtual Machine wizard, click Next; on the next page, I can pick a virtual machine and click next; name a computer program in the list and click Next; if the one program isn’t available, I can click another program and click Next; on the next page, I click Using the Recommended RAM and then click Next; click the existing hard disk drive and click Next; next, browse for the location of the VHD created then click Next; and finally, I finish the wizard. Now in the Virtual PC Console, I start the operating system. After all that, I should be able to create a clone of the Windows machine. If it functions perfectly, I may be able to utilize my password that I used on my actual machine. Then I have successfully created an exact copy of my Windows computer to a virtual machine.
 
 # Career Exploration
 
2.	q) Tri-C College Central: Take some time to explore the resources and report your findings. Upload CollegeCentral screenshot of listings. 

a) First, I clicked the Tri-C College Central site, then clicked the Students button where I created a new account and password that took me to the Jobs Search site by which I clicked the ‘Search – Intern Central’ switch where I typed the name of the state, city, and zip code which showed me the listing of not only the intern jobs, but also the cities where they are located and the posted dates that we supposedly took and uploaded.

 
3.	 q) Go to: Bureau of Labor Statistics and continue exploring careers in IT (or your area of interest.) Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth.      

a)	One career interest in the IT field is Software Testing. Software Testing is a process of verifying a computer system/program to decide whether it meets the specified requirements and produces the desired results. As a result, we identify bugs/viruses in the software community. One job title of Software Testing is smoke testing: Like for instance, assume you’ve ordered a book from Amazon, etc.; the moment you receive the parcel, the first thing you do is to check that the parcel is addressed to, and then make sure that parcel is intact and not torn; next, you open the parcel and see the book is what you ordered and also make sure it is new, and not old, used, or something totally different from your exact order listing. And as the payroll is concern, the average annual salary of a software test engineer is $82,212 which increases as per the experience and differs from company to company and the software engineer’s salary in the United States is between $60,000 and $108,000 per year. With the projected growth however, this type of software testing has exceeded USD 40 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 6% from 2020 to 2026.
## Certifications
4.	q)  Explore a certification from those listed below and report your findings. 
   CompTIA, Cisco, CISSP or any other certification.  
   
   a) One certification listed below is CompTIA which is an IT workforce that applies behavioral analytics to networks and devices to prevent, detect and combat cybersecurity threats.

## College Certificates
5.	q)  Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.) 

a) This Tri-C IT certificate I have explored is the Short-Term which is 3D Design. It provides students with education and professional development opportunities in 3D Design and Visualization. Here, students can participate in a fast-track sequence focusing on the fundamentals of 3D Modeling and Animation.

6.	q)  Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of   pursuing a co-op or internship. 

a) Both Cooperative (Co-op) and Internship Education students currently enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College must complete 12 credit hours of college coursework (including transfer credits) with t least two courses related to their major field and a GPA of 2.75 or higher. The difference between Internships and Co-ops is that an Internship is a form of on-the-job training that gives the student the opportunity to test out possible career or position while still in school while a co-op (also known as cooperative education) is a form of experiential learning which combines classroom-based education with full- or part-time, paid employment in position related to student’s field of study.   

## Professional Membership
7.	q) Pick one of the organization and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.  

a) The organization of Computer Science and Engineering provides links to information on al topics related to computer science and engineering in relevant databases, journals, conference proceedings, technical reports, websites, professional, etc. 


# Conclusion: Virtual machines are a superb instrumentation. It can also be valuable lifesaver in the event of a computer virus.
