Executive Summary: In this lesson, Lesson 7, I have learned a new program called python. This is actually the first time I’ve ever worked something like it, but it got very simple to operate and was awfully pleased that I am able to utilize a wide variety of functions which I had implemented with incredible ease and was appallingly successful.

Python
1.	q) Upload screenshot of the program you created along with the run output. 
2.	q) Based on the videos you watched about Python and class exercise, explain your understanding AND give an example of 
•	A variable. a) A variable can be “spam.”
•	An assignment statement. a) A statement that evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.
•	A function. It is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
•	Three data types. a) The three data types are integers, decimals or floats, or strings such as text or words.

Command Line
3.	Upload screenshots for the Activity 3 to GitHub.
Conclusion: In the future, I hoped to become even more successful with the much more complex programs. It will give a fighting chance for to finally understand computing as easily than the previous times I have taken these IT courses.
