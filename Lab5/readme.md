Executive Summary
The only explanation I can give is that the logical computing gates are symbolic images which utilize inputs and the resulting outputs depending on each of their different function. 

Hardware - Logic Gates and Circuits

1. q) Upload screenshots of the Logic gates groupwork. 

Software

2. q) Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each.
	a) Application software is, essentially, software that allows the user to accomplish some goal or purpose; a utility system is software that allows you to fix or modify your computer in some way or fashion; and operating system software which provides several essential functions, including: managing the hardware resources of the computer, providing the user-interface components, and providing a platform for software developers to write applications. There are examples of these software systems which are application software like Excel; utility software which is Antivirus; and the operating system like Windows 10.

3. q) Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example.
 	a) The purpose of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is to allow an organization to use a system of integrated applications to manage the business and automate many back office functions related to technology, service and human resources. One example of an ERP system is Made2Manage for engineer-to-order manufacturing.

4. q) In addition to the chapter use the following resource: https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html#how-it-works and explain the purpose of virtualization.
a) The purpose of virtualization is to create a server, desktop, operating system, file, storage or network. The main goal of virtualization is to manage workloads by radically transforming traditional computing to make it more scalable.


Virtualization

Read the article https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization

Explain the following:

5. q) What types of problems are solved with virtualization?
a) The types of problems virtualization can remedy are VM sprawl, backward compatibility, performance monitoring, backup, and security.

6. q) What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?
a) The hypervisor drives the concept of virtualization by allowing the physical host machine to operate multiple virtual machines as guests to help maximize the effective use of computing resources such as memory, bandwidth and CPU cycles.

Continue learning about virtualization by exploring cloud computing vs. virtualization:

7. q) In your own words explain the difference between cloud computing and virtualization.
a) A Virtualization is a software that virtualizes hardware into multiple machines while Cloud computing is the combination of multiple hardware devices. 

8. q) Explain how a network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing?
a) Virtualization in Cloud Computing is a process in which the user of cloud shares the data present in the cloud which can be application software etc. It provides a virtual environment in the cloud which can be software, hardware, or any other thing.

Conclusion.

This is how different hardware and software work in concert with one another. It all depends on the way their systems function in both the real world and cyberspace.
