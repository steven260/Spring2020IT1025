These are the directions in converting the usual decimal numbers into machine language binary and hexadecimal numerals and back again.

# Hardware -  Logic Gates and Circuits 

*1. q) Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate. 
	a) A NAND gate (sometimes referred to by its extended name, Negated AND gate) is a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and one output with behavior that is the opposite of an AND gate.
 
* 2. q) How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? 	a) In the NAND gate, if both input A and B are true, the output is false while in the AND gate the output is true.

# Data Representation - Numeric conversions

* 3. q) Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers. a) Decimal numbers are any given number such as the number 169, while its binary is 10101001 and hexadecimal is 0a9.

4. q) Upload screenshots of your worksheet.  1.	a) With the decimal number 169, I can convert it to binary this way: (128*1) + (64*0) + (32*1) + (16*1) + (8*1) + (4*0) + (2*0) + (1*1), as in hexadecimal which can be (16*10) + (9*1).

# Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation 
 
* 5. q) Explain the representation: #ff016b using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ff016b. 1.	a) On this particular site are countless combinations of color patterns. To make a long story short, the one I have chosen are the primary colors of Red, Green, and Blue which produce a wide variety of colors in the light spectrum.
 
* 6. q) When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.
